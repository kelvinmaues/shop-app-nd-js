# What's MVC?
 Separation of concerns

## Models
- Represent your data in your code
- Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)
- Contains data-related logic

## Views
- What the users see
- Decoupled from yout application code
- Shouldn't contain too much logic

## Controllers
- Connecting your *Models* and your *Views*
- Contains the "in-between" logic
- Split across Middleware functions
